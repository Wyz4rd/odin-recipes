        <p class="para-description">Bangers and mash is a traditional British dish 
            consisting of sausages (bangers) served with 
            mashed potatoes (mash) and a rich onion gravy. 
            It is a popular and classic comfort food, often 
            found on pub menus. The name "bangers" comes 
            from British slang for sausages, which historically 
            would "bang" or burst during cooking due to their 
            high water content.
