    <h1>Bangers and mash with red onion gravy</h1>
    <p>Bangers and mash is a traditional British dish 
        consisting of sausages (bangers) served with 
        mashed potatoes (mash) and a rich onion gravy. 
        It is a popular and classic comfort food, often 
        found on pub menus. The name "bangers" comes 
        from British slang for sausages, which historically 
        would "bang" or burst during cooking due to their 
        high water content.
