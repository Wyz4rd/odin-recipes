        <p class="para-description">Spaghetti bolognese is a popular dish of spaghetti
            pasta served with a rich, slow-cooked meat sauce 
            known as Bolognese sauce or ragù. It is a global 
            comfort food, though the combination with spaghetti 
            is a non-Italian adaptation of the traditional dish 
            from Bologna, Italy.

        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large heavy-based 
                saucepan over medium heat. Add the 
                pancetta and cook for 2 mins. Add 
                the onion and garlic. Cook for 2
                mins or until the onion starts to 
                soften. Increase heat to high. Add 
                the mince. Cook, stirring with a 
                wooden spoon to break up lumps, 
                for 5 mins or until browned.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in the bolognese seasoning, 
                carrot and celery. Cook, stirring, 
                for 3 mins. Add Annalisa Italian Diced 
                Tomatoes, Campbell’s Real Stock Beef 
                and bay leaves. Bring to the boil. 
                Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer
                for 20 mins or until sauce reduces 
                and thickens slightly. Season.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook Spaghetti No 5 in a 
                saucepan of boiling water following 
                packet directions. Drain.
            </li>
            <li>Divide spaghetti among serving bowls.
                Spoon over the sauce. Top with basil
                and sprinkle with parmesan.
