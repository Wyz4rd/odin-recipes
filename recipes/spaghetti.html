        <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>
            After listening to Stanley Tucci lose his mind about this pasta and calling it life-changing<br> 
            and one of the best things he's ever eaten, I decided I'd give it a try. The results 
            were amazing<br> and the key to getting the toasted sweet taste of the zucchini was deep-frying it!
        </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="cooking-method">
        <li>1 quart sunflower oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>6 medium green zucchini</li>
        <li>4 ounces spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 basil leaves, torn into small pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 jar tomato pasta sauce</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Method</h3>
    <ol class="cooking-method">
        <li>
            <h2>Step 1</h2>
            Place sunflower oil in a deep fryer and heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            Slice zucchini into 1/8-inch rounds.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Step 2</h2>
            Add some zucchini to the hot oil and deep-fry until lightly browned, 4 to 5 
            minutes. Transfer to a single layer on paper towels to drain and repeat to 
            cook remaining zucchini. Let zucchini cool to room temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Step 3</h2>
            Transfer cooled zucchini to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Step 4</h2>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the 
            boiling water, stirring occasionally, until it's 2 minutes away from being 
            tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Step 5</h2>
            As you are cooking the spaghetti, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. 
            Add zucchini and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until it starts to release juices, 
            soften, and break down, 3 to 5 minutes. Add a couple splashes of the pasta water 
            to the zucchini, but don't overdo it. Break zucchini into small pieces with the 
            edge of a spoon or spatula. Reduce heat to low and toss in 
            basil and butter; stir until butter melts.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Step 6</h2>
            Grab spaghetti with tongs and transfer it right into the sauce; stir until coated. 
            Mix in Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses. Add a final splash of 
            pasta water and adjust salt if needed.
        </li>
        <h2>Step 7</h2>
            Serve with more grated cheese and fresh basil.
